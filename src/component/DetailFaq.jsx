          Are Arliva products suitable for all skin types?

        <div class="text-sm mt-6  space-y-4">
          <p>
            Yes, all Arliva products are formulated to be used on all skin
            types—including dry, oily, combination, and even sensitive skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            We understand that everyone has unique skin needs. That’s why we use
            gentle yet effective ingredients, such as hyaluronic acid,
            niacinamide, and clinically proven botanical extracts.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, all of our products are free from parabens, excess
            alcohol, and harsh synthetic fragrances. Arliva products have also
            gone through a dermatological testing process, so they are safe for
            long-term use without disrupting the skin barrier.
          </p>
          <p>
            For optimal results, you can use the “Skincare by Skin Type” feature
            on our website to find the product that best suits your skin
            condition and needs.
